  1. The socketio.run() line — pass your SSL cert paths and disable debug mode:

  socketio.run(app, debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=443,
               certfile='.chain.pem', keyfile='.key.pem')

  Key changes:
  - debug=False — never run debug mode in production (it enables the interactive debugger and reloader, which are security risks)
  - allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True — remove this; it's a dev-only flag. For production you should use a proper WSGI server (see below)
  - certfile / keyfile — point to your .chain.pem and .key.pem files
  - host='0.0.0.0' — bind to all interfaces (currently it defaults to 127.0.0.1)
  - port=443 — standard HTTPS port

  2. Use a production server instead of Werkzeug. The built-in Werkzeug server is not designed for production. With Flask-SocketIO, the recommended approach is to use eventlet or gevent as the async backend:

  pip install eventlet

  Then socketio.run() will automatically use eventlet when it's installed. Alternatively, you can put this behind gunicorn:

  gunicorn --certfile=.chain.pem --keyfile=.key.pem \
           --bind 0.0.0.0:443 --worker-class eventlet \
           -w 1 server:app

  3. CORS — line 11 has cors_allowed_origins="*". In production, restrict this to your actual domain:

  socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="https://yourdomain.com")

  4. No client-side changes needed — as long as your frontend connects using https:// URLs, Socket.IO will automatically use wss:// (secure WebSocket) instead of ws://.

  The most important takeaway: don't use the built-in Werkzeug server for production. Use gunicorn with eventlet (or a reverse proxy like nginx handling SSL termination in front of your app).


 im confused, you said i should install eventlet, should i also install gunicorn, or is it just one of the either that i should use?

● Good question. There are two approaches — pick one:

  Option A: socketio.run() with eventlet (simpler)

  Just install eventlet. Flask-SocketIO will detect it and use it as the production server automatically. You'd keep using socketio.run() in your code:

  pip install eventlet
  socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=443,
               certfile='.chain.pem', keyfile='.key.pem')

  This is the easier setup and works fine for moderate traffic.

  Option B: gunicorn + eventlet (more robust)

  Install both eventlet and gunicorn. You remove the socketio.run() call and instead launch the app via the command line:

  pip install eventlet gunicorn
  gunicorn --certfile=.chain.pem --keyfile=.key.pem \
           --bind 0.0.0.0:443 --worker-class eventlet \
           -w 1 server:app

  This gives you more control (graceful restarts, process management, logging config, etc.) and is the more "standard" production deployment.

  ---
  For your case, Option A is probably the easiest path — just install eventlet and update the socketio.run() line. You can always move to Option B later if you need more operational control.
